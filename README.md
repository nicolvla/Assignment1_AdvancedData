# Analysis of 'immigration services scams complaints' 2022-2025 - DCWP

## Data

This data analysis uses a spreadsheet (DCWP_Consumer_Complaints_20251010.csv) containing information about complaints against businesses submitted to the NYC Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP), which is available on the NYC Open Data website.
This dataset includes all consumer complaints that were resolved on or after July 2023.
The columns relevant to the analysis are:
  Intake date: the date the complaint was received by DCWP.
  Complaint code: indicates the type of business practice that is the subject of the complaint.
  Business category: the business activity or category that is the subject of the complaint.
  Result: the type of resolution for the complaint.
  Borough: the NYC borough where the business is located.
  Business name: the legal business name as filed with the New York State Secretary of State or County Clerk or, if an individual, the person’s first and last name.

The data is used in the story to show where and how problems with immigration service providers occur in New York City.
It highlights that Queens has the highest number of complaints and identifies the most common issues, such as non-delivery of paid services, false promises, and mishandled paperwork.
The analysis also points out which businesses are repeatedly cited and examines the outcomes of complaints, showing that most are closed without compensation or only resolved
through mediation. Overall, the data provides a clear, evidence-based picture of the scope, patterns, and consequences of consumer issues in the immigration services sector.

You can re-use the data to create visualizations like charts or a map highlighting “hot spots” where problematic businesses are concentrated.
Journalists or researchers could further investigate the owners, locations, and operations of these providers, helping to uncover recurring issues
and inform the public about which businesses may be unreliable or risky.

I'm a bilingual journalist and data reporter currently pursuing a Master’s in Journalism at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism in New York and interning at Gothamist.
My recent work focuses on immigration and Latino communities in the U.S., where I’ve reported on the struggles of undocumented street vendors and asylum seekers in New York, and Phoenix, for outlets like El País US and The Arizona Republic.
